# Haskell-Infix-Calculator
Haskell Infix calculator, using Monads

## Why I created this
* I had previous projects where I created an infix calculator,
  however I have improved and want to use Monads in order to achieve
  the same result. Monad's will help with reducing code and make it
  more clear
